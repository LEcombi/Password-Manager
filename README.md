# Password-Generator
This is a simple password generator in Python.

## Password-Manager
~~The Password Manager is not Safe Now. Its no Password for the database.~~ Its just a Beta-version

To use the Password Manager, install the following Packages:

    pip install cryptography
    pip install tk
    pip install configparser

Run the files **run.py** and **run2.py** to create a Key for the Database.

Please set a **Password** for the Database in the **run2.py** file.

## Data Storage
All data is stored internally on the user's device. This ensures that your data remains private and secure, as it never leaves your local environment.

### tip: Save your database in a Network Drive hostet by yourself
